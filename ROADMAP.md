# Development Roadmap: 2025-2026
*This roadmap is broken into four major updates, each with a clear theme and a set of features that progressively enrich 
the game.*

### v0.2 — The Combat & Skills Update + CEP (28.07.2025)
This update focuses on making combat the engaging, central pillar of the game and giving meaning to the player's skills.

1. **Combat Mechanics Overhaul** - Replace the simple damage exchange with a stat-based system. 
Combat outcomes will be determined by player and enemy stats.
2. **Skill Integration** - Integrate the `Strength`, `Agility`, and `Wisdom` skills directly into gameplay.
3. **Turn-Based Combat UI** - Expand the combat from a single message to an interactive, turn-based menu.
4. **Expanded Item Effects** - Add items that can be used during combat to affect the player or enemy.

### v0.3 — The World & Lore Update (Fall 2025)
With combat improved, this phase will make the world feel more alive, persistent, and worth exploring.

1. **Central Hub & NPCs** - Introduce a persistent or procedural town/location that the player can return to. 
This area will house some new NPCs.
2. **Merchant System** - Add a merchant NPC in the hub who buys and sells items. 
3. **Economy System** - Introduce a currency.
4. **Expanded Quests & New Quest Types** - Introduce a many new quest types that leverage the new world system. _(Maybe would be intoduce like CEP)_

### v0.4 — The Equipment & Crafting Update (X-mas 2026)
This update focuses on deepening character customization through a robust equipment and crafting system.

1. **Equipment System** - Allow the player to equip items into specific slots (e.g. Weapons, Armor, Amulets)
to gain stat bonuses.
2. **Simple Crafting System** - Allow the player to combine gathered materials to create new items,
such as potions or gear.

### v0.5 - The Content Update (2026)
With mature systems in place, this final phase will add a narrative arc, replayability, and long-term goals.

1. **Main Storyline** - Weave existing and new quests into a main storyline with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
2. **Bosses** - Introduce unique, powerful "boss" enemies at the conclusion of
major questlines or in special locations.
3. **Active Skills** - Expand the skill system to include active abilities that can be used in combat.
